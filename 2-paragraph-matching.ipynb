The other original sections from the June 2019 report can be found as labelled in the June 2019 report. PART A Explanation of the Taxonomy approach. This section sets out the role and importance of sustainable finance in Europe from a policy and investment perspective, the rationale for the development of an EU Taxonomy, the daft regulation and the mandate of the TEG. PART B Methodology. This explains the methodologies for developing technical screening criteria for climate change mitigation objectives, adaptation objectives and do no significant harm to other environmental objectives in the legislative proposal. This has been updated since 2019. PART C Taxonomy user and use case analysis. This section provides practical guidance to potential users of the Taxonomy, including case studies.  PART D Economic impacts of the Taxonomy. This section provides the TEGs analysis of the likely economic impacts of establishing an EU Taxonomy.  PART E  Next steps for the Taxonomy. This section elaborates on unresolved issues and potential ways forward for the Taxonomy and the technical work of the Platform on Sustainable Finance. PART F Full list of technical screening criteria. This annex sets out the sector and economic activityspecific technical screening criteria and rationale for the TEGs analysis. These have been updated since 2019.</td>\n",

The other original sections from the June 2019 report can be found as labelled in the June 2019 report. PART A Explanation of the Taxonomy approach. This section sets out the role and importance of sustainable finance in Europe from a policy and investment perspective, the rationale for the development of an EU Taxonomy, the daft regulation and the mandate of the TEG. PART B Methodology. This explains the methodologies for developing technical screening criteria for climate change mitigation objectives, adaptation objectives and do no significant harm to other environmental objectives in the legislative proposal. This has been updated since 2019. PART C Taxonomy user and use case analysis. This section provides practical guidance to potential users of the Taxonomy, including case studies.  PART D Economic impacts of the Taxonomy. This section provides the TEGs analysis of the likely economic impacts of establishing an EU Taxonomy.  PART E  Next steps for the Taxonomy. This section elaborates on unresolved issues and potential ways forward for the Taxonomy and the technical work of the Platform on Sustainable Finance.

(2) Adaptation   Refer to the screening criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation.  (3) Water   Identify and manage risks related to water quality andor water consumption at the appropriate level.

Impact of these proposals The activities do not impose major additional implementation costs on the stakeholders because (as explained) for most of them  except water collection, treatment and supply  the climate mitigation effects are an inherent result of key characteristics of the correspondent business models and thus should come along without significant further cost. Considering water collection, treatment and supply, additional investments may be necessary in order to reach certain thresholds, however the corresponding costs may partially be equalized by cost savings from higher energy efficiency. There should be no systematic distortive effect of the activities on the number and competitive position of the companies in the corresponding sectors. The overall sectoral technological impact will depend on the state of the water, wastewater and waste management in each Member State in terms of e.g. regional coverage of different management technologies. Outside of the EU the technological impact could be even greater if the state of the sector in an individual country or region is below that of the EU.

      "tfidf: 1.3  Reforestation Sector classification and activity MacroSector A  Agriculture, forest and silviculture NACE Level 2 Code A2 Description Reforestation Reforestation is defined as the reestablishment of forest through planting andor deliberate seeding on land classified as forest. It implies no change of land use, includes plantingseeding of temporarily unstocked forest areas as well as plantingseeding of areas with forest cover. It includes coppice from trees that were originally planted or seeded448. The FAO FRA definition of reforestation excludes natural regeneration. However, the Taxonomy recognises the importance of natural regeneration to the increased carbon sink and stock potential provided by forests in general. It is therefore included explicitly within this context in line with the FAO FRA definition of naturally regenerating forest449.\n",

The threshold for cement clinker needs to be revised every time that there is an update in the EU ETS benchmark value for grey cement clinker.  199 Threshold was derived taking into account the threshold for cement clinker and the threshold for clinker to cement ratio. It excludes emissions from electricity use that is mainly required for finish grinding, raw materials grinding and the exhaust fans (kilnraw mill and cement mill).\n",

      "tfidf: 4.7  Production of Electricity from Gas (not exclusive to natural gas) Sector classification and activity MacroSector D  Electricity, Gas, Steam and Air Conditioning Supply NACE Level 4 Code D.35.1.1 Description Construction and operation of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity from Gas Combustion (not exclusive to natural gas)  Mitigation criteria Principle  Support a transition to a netzero emissions economy  Avoidance of lockin to technologies which do not support the transition to a netzero emissions economy  Ensure that economic activities meet best practice standards  Ensure equal comparability within an economic activity with regards to achieving netzero emissions economy target  Where necessary, incorporating technologyspecific considerations into secondary metrics and thresholds Metric  Threshold Any electricity generation technology can be included in the taxonomy if it can be demonstrated, using an ISO 14067 or a GHG Protocol Product Lifecycle Standard compliant Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) assessment, that the life cycle impacts for producing 1 kWh of electricity are below the declining threshold.  A full PCF shall be applied, using project specific data where relevant and shall be subjected to review. This assessment should include actual physical measurements, i.e. methane leakage measurements across gas extraction, transport and storage systems. Declining threshold Facilities operating at life cycle emissions lower than 100gCO2ekWh, declining to 0gCO2ekWh by 2050, are eligible.   This threshold will be reduced every 5 years in line with a netzero CO2e in 2050 trajectory  Assets and activities must meet the threshold at the point in time when taxonomy approval is sought For activities which go beyond 2050, it must be technically feasible to reach netzero emissions Facilities that will incorporate any form of abatement (e.g. CCS, Cofiring, other) must show that the abatement activity is eligible under the Taxonomy.  Electricity generation from other fossilfuel based gases would be eligible under the Taxonomy, subject to meeting the declining emissions threshold. Combined Heat and Power is covered under Construction and operation of a facility used for cogeneration of heatcooling and Power threshold.\n",

      "doc2vec: 100 Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species and number of trees (in case of planting). The increment based on the growthyield curves gives the approximate number of how many m3yearha is available for increment. The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 0,5 ton of carbon. Further one ton of carbon equals 4412  3.67 tons of carbon dioxide 101 Landscape management level may be used to emphasize that the goal may be to perform at a scale above the single forest stand. Absence of landscape management access will in turn require disclosure at the single forest stand. The Forest Taxonomy leaves to forest owners and companies to explain, document on which level they report.  102 This threshold should apply considering the following force majeure clause underperformance resulting from natural disturbance can be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the thresholds and will not result in noncompliance with the Taxonomy criteria.\n",
